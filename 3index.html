                <p>Spring is in the air and life in Nature is coming alive with excitement here at Algonquin Park, a perfect time to take a romantic vacation at Couples Resort and visit Algonquin Park.</p> 
                <p>Weather here in the spring can often be several degrees warmer than if you live near places like Lake Ontario as the ground here can warm up fast and we have no big Lake effect keeping air cool. Here you can enjoy outdoor hiking and horseback riding https://ridethewilderness.com  plus many other sports and attractions.</p> 
                <p>Whether you are a couple that wants to find that special time together uninterrupted or as a gift to someone special in your life, this experience will bring you closer together, and that is what life is all about.
                    </p> 
                <p>The resort sits at the edge of a tiny Village, Whitney, and on a gorgeous Algonquin Park Lake, Galeairy Lake. This Lake is 11 km long, Semi-Private and 95% undeveloped so it is great for discovering hidden bays and exploring what nature has to offer along the shorelines.</p> 
                <p>
                    Couples Resort is All-Inclusive and you will enjoy romantic gourmet dinners and breakfasts in bed. Includes: Canoe, Kayak, Tennis, Mountain Bike and Hike the many trails.</p>

                 <p>Spring offers the year's best Moose viewing and you typically don't have to search very hard to see Moose. The application of salt to Highway 60 during winter road maintenance operations, attracts Moose to roadside ditches.

             <p>From late April into May, a select group of wildflowers called “spring ephemerals” grow and bloom in the brief window between the spring snow melt and leaf-out of the overhead canopy of trees. Once the canopy has filled in, very little light reaches the forest floor and many of these wildflowers go into dormancy until the next year, staying alive as a rootstock underground.</p>
